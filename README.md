# Stemming
Implementation of some stemming algorithms implemented as the origianl proposals, and using deterministic finite automata in a level of character and bits. The current version of the project is test for only English language.

## Running the tests
To run the tests available you only need to alter the input and output path files on the test classes (stemmer.test.ADS.EnADS and stemmer.test.Bsl.EnBsl).
```
String inputFile = "p2_voc.txt";
String outputFile = "p2_outvoc_bsl.txt";
```
